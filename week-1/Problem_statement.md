# Problem Statement

Rural artisans play a vital role in preserving traditional crafts and cultural heritage. However, most artisans face difficulties in accessing larger markets due to lack of digital exposure, dependence on middlemen, limited pricing control, and absence of secure online payment systems.

Existing e-commerce platforms are either too complex for rural users or do not provide fair visibility and profit-sharing mechanisms for artisans. As a result, artisans are unable to directly connect with customers, leading to reduced income and loss of traditional craftsmanship.

The proposed system, **GramBazaar**, aims to develop a digital marketplace that connects rural artisans directly with consumers. The platform will provide user-friendly interfaces, secure payment gateways, transparent order tracking, and fair pricing, thereby empowering artisans and promoting sustainable rural entrepreneurship.
