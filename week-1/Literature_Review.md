# Literature Review

Several studies and platforms have addressed digital marketplaces and rural empowerment. A review of existing systems reveals both strengths and limitations.

### 1. E-commerce Platforms (Amazon, Flipkart)
These platforms provide wide market reach but are not artisan-focused. Small-scale artisans face issues such as high commission charges, limited visibility, and complex onboarding processes.

### 2. Government Initiatives (GeM, TRIFED, ONDC)
Government-supported platforms promote rural products but often lack modern user experience, efficient logistics integration, and personalized marketing features.

### 3. Artisan-Focused Platforms (Etsy, Okhai)
These platforms offer better visibility to artisans but have limitations such as restricted regional focus, higher service fees, and limited local language support.

### Research Gap
- Lack of a simple, localized platform for rural artisans
- Limited transparency in pricing and order tracking
- Insufficient digital literacy support for artisans

### Conclusion
The literature review highlights the need for a dedicated platform that balances usability, fairness, and scalability. GramBazaar aims to address these gaps by offering a localized, transparent, and artisan-centric digital marketplace.
